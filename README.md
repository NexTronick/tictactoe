# tictactoe
This is just a simple personal project. I just wanted to make tic tac toe, it uses the console to play the game, its pretty straight forward.
The TicTacToe.java file can be copy pasted onto NetBeans or can be run directly by console using javac command.
The game is player vs player, in future there will be player vs computer added.
You can test this game out play it with your friends or family.
All the code is done by me and its for sure not the best code. There are many comments so its easier for any beginner to understand pretty straight forward.
